# 💰 The Family Money Manager 📊

Hey there! Welcome to my super cool money tracking app! Ever had your money pull a disappearing act at the end of the month? Yeah, me too! 😅 That's exactly why I built this!

## 🌟 The Cool Story Behind This

So picture this: I'm a student watching my money vanish into thin air (sounds familiar, right?), when one day I spot my grandfather's old accounting book. And let me tell you, this thing was GENIUS in its simplicity!


He had this amazing system - just four simple columns:

| Date 📅 | Flow ⬆️ | Balance 💵 | Reason 📝 |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 15 Feb  | -₹100   | ₹900      | Midnight pizza 🍕 |
| 16 Feb  | +₹500   | ₹1400     | Birthday gift from mom 🎁 |

Now you can see exactly:
- When did you spend it? (Date) 📅
- How much went in or out? (like -₹100 for that midnight snack) ⬆️
- What's left in your pocket? (Balance) 💵
- Why did you spend it? (we all need receipts!) 📝


I loved it so much, I thought "Hey, why not turn this into an app?" And here we are! A year and many late-night coding sessions later... 🌙

## 🎮 How to Use It (Super Simple!)

1. **Getting Started:**
   ```bash
   pip install prettytable rich
   python main.py
   ```
   Just type your name and you're in! 🎉

2. **Adding Your Money Stuff:**
   - Got some money? Type `+500` or just `500`
   - Spent some money? Type `-500`
   - Lending to a friend? Type `g500` (g for "give")
   - Friend paying back? Type `t500` (t for "take")

3. **Cool Commands:**
   - Want to quit? Type `q`
   - Messed up? Type `u` to undo
   - Need help? Type `help`
   - Want to see who owes you money? Type `people`
   - Need a record? Type `export`

## ✨ What Makes This Special?

- **Never Loses Your Stuff:** Everything saves automatically!
- **Super Clean Look:** Nice, neat tables that actually make sense
- **Tracks Your Friends:** Know who owes you money (and who you owe 😉)
- **Export Power:** Save everything as text files for when your parents ask where all the money went 😅

## 🎯 The Fun Features

1. **Smart Memory:** Remembers everything so you don't have to
2. **Friend Tracker:** No more "Hey, did I pay you back?" moments
3. **Clean and Clear:** Everything's organized neat and tidy
4. **Undo Button:** Because we all make mistakes! 

## 🚧 Tiny Limitations (Being Honest Here!)

- No decimal points yet (whole numbers only!)
- Works with rupees (₹) only
- Lives in the terminal (old school cool 😎)

## 🔮 Future Dreams

Planning to add:
- A pretty window interface (mobile app)
- Cloud saving
- Budget planning (for when we get serious about saving 😉)
- Cool graphs and charts

## 🐛 Any Problems?

Works like a charm on Windows 10! I've also been using it on my Android phone with Pydroid for a whole year without any hiccups! 📱
Just a heads up: If the tables look a bit squished on your screen, try increasing your terminal's font size. Think of it like adjusting your glasses - sometimes you just need the right fit! 🔍

## 💝 One Last Thing...

Happy Money Tracking! 🎉
